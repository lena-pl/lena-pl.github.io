			<h2>Fly to the Limit</h2>
			<p>
			  This is my first fully designed and coded website, completed as part of my studies at Yoobee School of Design.
			</p>
			<p>
			  I learned a lot while creating this project, especially about using Javascript plug-ins and third party code. We wrote a form validation kit in class, but I also used a Javascript date plugin called Rome (you can find it on Nicolas Bevacqua's Github) and the Magnific Popup gallery (you can find this plugin on Dmitry Semenov's Github). I also found a few great CSS tricks for styling forms and placeholder text, which added a nice extra touch!
