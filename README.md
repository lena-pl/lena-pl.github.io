This is a project for Lena Plaksina's Portfolio.

It's currently still a work in progress - I'm using it as a tool to both display what I've learned so far and to learn new skills along the way. 

As a static site, it only uses HTML5, CSS (preprocessed through Sass), and a basic Javascript sorting function. I'm also storing a few versions of dynamic pages in the repo that I'm experimenting with on my local server.
